<h1>AI Education</h1>
<p>According to Unesco, "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and accelerate progress towards SDG 4. However, rapid technological developments inevitably bring multiple risks and challenges, which have so far outpaced policy debates and regulatory frameworks. UNESCO is committed to supporting Member States to harness the potential of AI technologies for achieving the Education 2030 Agenda, while ensuring that its application in educational contexts is guided by the core principles of inclusion and equity."&nbsp;</p>
<h2>AI Entertainment</h2>
<p>According to Orientsoftware, "On the media and entertainment space, machine learning and AI-based technologies soon held a solid position. Just like how our daily activities, from small, tiny things to bigger deals, have been gradually intertwined with robots; AI has dominated a wide range of activities in terms of the media and entertainment business. And its applications are only getting more and more advanced over time."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
